# Python Test Scripts

## Overview
The current directory contains two disctinct python scripts. The first python script determines if a given number is even or odd, and the second obtains the squares and cubes of a given list.


## Files

### even_or_odd.py
The python script 'even_or_odd' determines if the numbers of a given list are even or odd. It prints to screen each digit followed by "is even" or "is odd" as appropriate.

### squares_and cubes.py
The file squares_and_cubes.py obtains the squares and cubes of a given list that contains numbers. All three lists are printed out side-by-side in three columns

## Example Output

### even_or_odd.py
After running the python script, you will obtain results that look similar to the ones below:
`10 is even.\n

After running the python script, you will obtain results that look similar to th
e ones below:\n
`1 1 1
2 4 8
3 9 27
